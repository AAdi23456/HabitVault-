Consistency beats intensity — that’s the philosophy behind HabitVault. Most habit apps are bloated or distracting. This one is minimalist, focused, and built for tracking progress with visual clarity and emotional rewards.

Users log habits daily, maintain streaks, and gain insight into their personal productivity over time through visual dashboards.

You're tasked with building a clean, secure MVP for this daily habit tracker.

🎯 Objective:
Build a fullstack application where authenticated users can:

Add, manage, and track personal habits
Check off completed habits each day
Maintain streaks and view completion heatmaps
Visualize performance over time
Persist user settings locally for a personalized experience
👥 User Role: user
There is a single user role. All data is scoped to the authenticated user.

🔐 Authentication & Authorization:
Secure login and registration via email/password
All habit data and user preferences must be scoped to the logged-in user only
Habits should not be accessible or editable outside of auth context
🧱 Core Functional Features:
1. Add & Manage Habits
Users can:
Add a new habit (e.g., “Drink 2L water”)
Set:
Name
Target Days (e.g., Every Day, Weekdays, Custom)
Start Date
Edit or delete habits anytime
Each habit has a unique ID and is displayed in a card/grid view
2. Daily Check-In System
For each day:
Users can mark a habit as Completed or Missed
This logs the status with a timestamp
UI must support:
Viewing all habits for today
Toggling completion status
Inline feedback like ✅/❌ or checkbox
3. Habit Streaks Logic
For each habit, calculate:
Current streak (consecutive days)
Longest streak
Display streak counter clearly on each habit card
Missed day resets current streak to 0
4. Visual Habit History View
Heatmap or calendar-style view showing:
Days habits were completed (green)
Days missed (red or faded)
Supports navigation by month/week
5. Analytics Dashboard
Visualizations for:
Total habits created
Completion rate (e.g., 74% of all habit days completed)
Best-performing habit (based on streaks or completion rate)
Simple bar/pie/line charts, clean UX
6. localStorage Use (Mandatory)
Store the following locally:
Dark mode preference
Last selected time range (week/month) on analytics view
Daily motivational quote toggle (on/off)
All should persist across refresh & relogin
7. Daily Motivational Quote Section
Static set of quotes (or fetch from public API)
Show one quote per day on the dashboard
Must rotate or update daily (based on date logic)
8. UI/UX Considerations
Prioritize mobile-responsiveness for check-ins
Friendly empty states when no habits are added
Habit cards should include visual indicators for streaks and check-in status
🧪 Additional Notes:
You may allow re-checking habits from past days (e.g., if someone forgot to log yesterday)
Habit status can be stored as a date-based object per habit (e.g., habitId: { '2024-04-14': 'completed' })
Emphasis should be on a satisfying, rewarding, “I want to come back tomorrow” vibe in ux.
